the first column represents the first sample, of the \code{y}-variable(s).}

\item{weights_y}{the prespecified 1 times n weighting vector for \code{y}-values.}

\item{r_xy_errors}{the prespecified correlation coefficient between the errors
in \code{X} and \code{Y}. Either a 1 times n vector or a single value.}

\item{tolerance}{the tolerance for convergence of the slope coefficent. The default
is \code{1e-5}.}

in x are known.}

\item{mult_samples}{\code{logical}. Default is \code{FALSE}. Change to TRUE, if the input is
a data frame with multiple samples of both x and y.}

\item{approx_solution}{\code{logical}. Default is \code{FALSE}. Change to TRUE, if you want an
approximate solution of the slope coefficients. No iteration is needed.
TRUE is not recommended when the accuracy for the slope coefficient shall be
more than one decimal point.}

\value{
York Returns an object of class "york". An
 object of class "york" is a list containing the following components:

   y-values, the errors sd_x- and sd_y and the correlation of the errors
   (error_correlation). If the input are multiple samples the data element will be
   a list containing the observed points x-, y-values, the errors sd_x- and sd_y
   and the correlation of the errors (error_correlation), the errors in x and y
   (x_errors// y_errors) and the mean of each obersvation i for variable x
   and y, respectively (mean_x_i// mean).}

\description{
The function york is used to fit a model when both X and Y variables are
 subject to measurement errors. The york function returns an object of class
 "york", which is a fit of a York's regression. The model can also take into
 account correlations between x and y errors.
}
\details{
\code{york} implements the algorithm for the problem of the
 best-Ô¨Åt straight line to independent points with errors in both x and y
 variables. General York (1969) solution according to the algorithm of Wehr & Saleska
 (2017).

 Given \eqn{n} pairs of \eqn{(x_i, y_i), i = 1, \ldots, n}, their
 weights \eqn{(\omega(x_i), \omega(y_i)), i = 1, \ldots, n} or their standard
 errors \eqn{sd(x_i)} and \eqn{sd(y_i)}, the \code{york} function finds the
 best-fit straight line using the algorithm of York et al. (1966)/ York et
 al. (1969) as presented in Wehr & Saleska (2017). In addition, the function
 provides numerous statistics, parameters and goodness of fit criteria. If
 the data contains NA values they will be omitted.

\examples{
 # Example: York's regression with weight data taken from Pearson (1901):
 x <- c(0.0, 0.9, 1.8, 2.6, 3.3, 4.4, 5.2, 6.1, 6.5, 7.4)
 y <- c(5.9, 5.4, 4.4, 4.6, 3.5, 3.7, 2.8, 2.8, 2.4, 1.5)
 weights_x <- c(1e+3, 1e+3, 5e+2, 8e+2, 2e+2, 8e+1, 6e+1, 2e+1, 1.8, 1)
 weights_y <- c(1, 1.8, 4, 8, 20, 20, 70, 70, 1e+2, 5e+2)
 r_xy_errors <- 0
 york(x, y, weights_x, weights_y, r_xy_errors)

 # Example: York's regression arbitrary values for sd_x and sd_y:
 x <- c(0.0, 0.9, 1.8, 2.6, 3.3, 4.4, 5.2, 6.1, 6.5, 7.4)
 y <- c(5.9, 5.4, 4.4, 4.6, 3.5, 3.7, 2.8, 2.8, 2.4, 1.5)
 sd_x <- 0.2
 sd_y <- 0.4
 r_xy_errors <- 0.3

 # fit york model
 york(x, y, sd_x = sd_x, sd_y = sd_y, r_xy_errors = r_xy_errors)

\dontrun{
 # Example: No standard errors or weights specified
 york(x, y, r_xy_errors = 0)

 # Example: You can't specify weights and standard errors at the same time
 york(x , y, sd_x, sd_y, weights_x, weights_y, r_xy_errors = 0)
